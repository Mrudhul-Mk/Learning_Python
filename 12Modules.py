#Every python file is a module
# we use modules to breakdown large programs into small manageable and organised files
# modules provide reusability of code.
# module is simply a python file with .py extension. The name of the file becomes the module name.
'''
Structured Code:
code is logically organized by being grouped into one python file which makes development easier and less error-prone

code is easier to understand and use

Reusability:
Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused by other parts of the application
this eliminates the need to recreate duplicate code'''
